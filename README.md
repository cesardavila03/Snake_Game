<h1>Snake Game in Python</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Snake Game repository! This project is a classic Snake Game developed using Python and Pygame. The player controls a snake that grows in length as it eats apples. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the screen borders. This project demonstrates basic game development concepts, including graphics rendering, event handling, and collision detection.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

- <b>Classic snake gameplay where the snake grows as it eats apples.</b> 
- <b>Real-time rendering and smooth animations using Pygame.</b>
- <b>Collision detection for game over scenarios when the snake hits itself or the screen borders.</b> 
- <b>Score display to keep track of the player's progress.</b>

<h2>How to Play</h2>

1. <b>Run the ‘Snake_Game.py’ script.</b>
2. <b>Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement:</b>
- <b>Up arrow to move up</b> 
- <b>Down arrow to move down</b>
- <b>Left arrow to move left</b> 
- <b>Right arrow to move right</b>
3. <b>Eat the red apples to grow the snake.</b>
4. <b>Avoid running into the snake's body or the screen borders to keep playing.</b>
5. <b>The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the borders.</b>

<h2>Code Overview</h2>

<b>The main components of the Snake Game are:</b>
- <b>Pygame Initialization: Sets up the game window and initializes necessary components.</b>
- <b>Snake Class: Handles the snake's position, movement, and collision detection.</b>
- <b>Apple Class: Manages the apple's position and rendering.</b>
- <b>Game Loop: Handles events, updates the game state, and renders the game objects.</b>
